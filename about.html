    <h1>About</h1>
    <br>
    <p style="width: 75%;">Your Lie in April (Japanese: 四月は君の嘘, Hepburn: Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso) is a Japanese romantic drama manga series that
    was written and illustrated by Naoshi Arakawa, and has been adapted into an anime television series and multiple stage
    productions. The manga was serialized in Kodansha's shōnen manga (manga aimed at teenage boys) magazine Monthly Shōnen
    Magazine from April 2011 to May 2015. The story follows a young pianist named Kо̄sei Arima, who loses the ability to
    hear the piano after his mother's death and his experiences after he meets violinist Kaori Miyazono.</p>
    <p style="width: 75%;">The manga series originated from a one-shot comic that Arakawa entered in a competition; he based the series on it and
    drew inspiration from similar works, such as Beck and Nodame Cantabile. A-1 Pictures adapted Your Lie in April into an
    anime television series that was aired on Fuji TV's Noitamina block from October 2014 to March 2015, and an original
    video animation (OVA) episode was released in May 2015. A live-action film adaptation of the same name was released in
    September 2016. The series has also been adapted into a stage play, a light novel, and a musical that is set to premiere
    in May 2022.</p>
    <p style="width: 75%;">Your Lie in April received mixed reviews; several critics praised its plot and characters but criticized the artwork.
    Critics largely acclaimed the anime adaptation for its plot, animation, and soundtrack.</p>

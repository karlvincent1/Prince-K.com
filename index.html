    <p style="width: 50%;">Kousei Arima is the main protagonist of the series Your Lie in April. He is the youngest winner of the Maihou Piano
    Competition. He became a pianist thanks to the encouragements of his mother's close friend. He tends to be oblivious of
    what happens around him, to not notice the feelings from the other people such as the rivalry of his competitor
    pianists, or Tsubaki Sawabe's crush on him.</p>

    <h2>Tsubaki Sawabe</h2>
    <img src="/images/Tsubaki.png" width="400" alt="tsubaki">
    <p style="width: 50%;">Tsubaki is Kousei Arima's childhood friend who has always gone to his performances and cheered him on. Tsubaki would
    often invite Kousei to play outside but due to his practice time with his mother, Kousei could rarely participate. Being
    with Kousei for a long time, Tsubaki gradually took on the role of an "older sister". Kousei was that "hopeless little
    brother she had to take care of". She would often prepare gifts for Kousei and cheer him up when he was sad, such as
    when his mother abandoned his pet cat he had found and he couldn't find him. Rather than being interested in music,
    Tsubaki was always athletic.</p>
